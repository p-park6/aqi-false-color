*This repo uses content from the UCSB MEDS EDS 220 Assignments*

This is a repository covering the Thomas fire in CA air quality, and the false color image of the Thomas fire area.

## About
This repository contains a notebook named `thomas-fire-aqi-false-color.ipynb`. This notebook looks at the air quality in Santa Barbara over time, which is where the Thomas fire took place. It also includes a map of a false color image centered around where the Thomas fire took place.

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to see if there was a significant change in air quality as well as a noticeable indicator of the false color image during the time the Thomas fire took place.

## Main features
- Data tidying and filtering with `pandas`
- Data statistical analysis
- Geospacial data tidying with `geopandas`
- Visualizing data through the forms of a graph and map
